<p>Hilbert’s axioms are grouped into five categories. We explain each below:</p>

## I. Axioms of Incidence

**1. Two distinct points determine a line.**  
For any points \( A \) and \( B \), there is a line \( a \) such that \( A \in a \) and \( B \in a \).

**2. Uniqueness of that line.**  
If \( A, B \in a \cap b \), then \( a = b \).

...

## IV. Axiom of Parallels

**19. Playfair’s Axiom**  
Given a line \( a \) and a point \( P \notin a \), there exists at most one line through \( P \) parallel to \( a \).

...

## V. Axiom of Continuity

**20. Archimedean Property**  
If a set of points on a line has an upper bound, it has a least upper bound.
